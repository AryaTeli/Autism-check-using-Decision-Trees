# Autism-check-using-Decision-Trees
Machine Learning model for predicting autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using decision trees. Designed with simplicity, the model efficiently determines whether an individual may have ASD based on input features related to behavior and development.

## Features

- Decision Tree Algorithm: The model utilizes a decision tree approach for ASD classification, ensuring reliability and interpretability.

- Binary Classification: The model simplifies the ASD prediction task into a binary classification problem, making it easy to interpret the results as either positive or negative for ASD.

- Clear Interpretation: Decision trees provide transparent rules for classification, allowing users to understand the reasoning behind each prediction.

- Flexible Parameters: Users can adjust model parameters to suit specific dataset characteristics or research needs, enhancing adaptability across various scenarios.
